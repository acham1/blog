    <p><span class="tagline">Carving up a big old chair into smaller goodies.</span></p>

<p>I had some 70s era chairs from a garage sale purchase, just a couple months ago. But they were in poor condition; for example, the leather had not been conditioned, the dry straps cracking or snapped in places. They hogged space in the shop (garage) too, just gathering sawdust.</p>

<p>I bought them as they were cheap and made of good mahogany. For most of my past projects I’ve mainly stuck to cheaper, construction grade redwood or pine, so this was a happy find.</p>

<p>Finally, today I tried an simple mini-project with reusing the wood.</p>

<h1 id="before">Before</h1>

<p>This poor fellow was selected for today’s harvest.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/chair-tie/chairs.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="ouch">Ouch</h1>

<p>The leather was labor intensive to remove cleanly due to the old nails. A few times, the nail head broke off, and I’d dig the decapitated nail stalk out of the wood.</p>

<p>Unwisely, I also left some loose nails on the floor, and I stepped on one. It pierced through the sole of my shoes, jabbing the pad of my foot, but I stopped before it drew blood.</p>

<h1 id="leather-scraps">Leather Scraps</h1>

<p>Some leather scraps came out of the disassembly too, but those will probably go out in the next trash collection. They’re not in great condition.</p>

<h1 id="salvaged-lumber">Salvaged Lumber</h1>

<p>The boards were pretty skinny, but that’s really ok. I want to start focusing on smaller palm-sized projects anyway – things that I can start and finish in one weekend without ado.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/chair-tie/chopped-chairs.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="cubes">Cubes</h1>

<p>One of the cross bars from the chair seat was riddled with snapped nails I couldn’t remove. So I milled out a short three-inch segment of clear wood between the nails.</p>

<p>After some fiddling with the band saw and sand paper, these two cuties came about, about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1" x 1"</code> in size.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/chair-tie/cubes.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="hair-ties">Hair Ties</h1>

<p>It became a little hair tie with the help of some butcher block conditioner (it was what I had) and an elastic hair tie (donated by my roommate).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/chair-tie/hair-tie.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>

<p>I’d like to try this again, with some lessons learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a lighter finish to preserve the wood’s natural color without darkening it so much.</li>
  <li>Use one cube per hair-tie. Two is unwieldy and makes the elastic band hard to “double-up”.</li>
  <li>Use a lower profile approach to fasten the hair tie terminals.</li>
  <li>Use a larger board to start, because running the saw for tiny objects like this can be scary. Fingers get close to blades.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to home furniture, I had fun making these basic cubes; plus I now have a proof of concept for reusing lumber from the chairs.</p>

<p>I look forward to trying the cubes again soon, and then moving on to other project ideas with the salvaged lumber.</p>
