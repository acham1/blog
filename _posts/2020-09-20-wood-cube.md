I had some 70s era chairs from a garage sale purchase, just a couple months ago. But they were in poor condition; for example, the leather had not been conditioned, the dry straps cracking or snapped in places. They hogged space in the shop (garage) too, just gathering sawdust. 

I bought them as they were cheap and made of good mahogany. For most of my past projects I've mainly stuck to cheaper, construction grade redwood or pine, so this was a happy find. 

Finally, today I tried an simple mini-project with reusing the wood.

# Before

This poor fellow was selected for today's harvest.

# Ouch

The leather was labor intensive to remove cleanly due to the old nails. A few times, the nail head broke off, and I'd dig the decapitated nail stalk out of the wood. 

Unwisely, I also left some loose nails on the floor, and I stepped on one. It pierced through the sole of my shoes, jabbing the pad of my foot, but I stopped before it drew blood.

# Leather Scraps

Some leather scraps came out of the disassembly too, but those will probably go out in the next trash collection. They're not in great condition.

# Salvaged Lumber

The boards were pretty skinny, but that's really ok. I want to start focusing on smaller palm-sized projects anyway -- things that I can start and finish in one weekend without ado.

# Cubes

One of the cross bars from the chair seat was riddled with snapped nails I couldn't remove. So I milled out a short three-inch segment of clear wood between the nails.

After some fiddling with the band saw and sand paper, these two cuties came about, about `1" x 1"` in size.

# Hair Ties

It became a little hair tie with the help of some butcher block conditioner (it was what I had) and an elastic hair tie (donated by my roommate).

# Next Steps

I'd like to try this again, with some lessons learned:

- Use a lighter finish to preserve the wood's natural color without darkening it so much.
- Use one cube per hair-tie. Two is unwieldy and makes the elastic band hard to "double-up".
- Use a lower profile approach to fasten the hair tie terminals.
- Use a larger board to start, because running the saw for tiny objects like this can be scary. Fingers get close to blades.

Compared to home furniture, I had fun making these basic cubes; plus I now have a proof of concept for reusing lumber from the chairs.

I look forward to trying the cubes again soon, and then moving on to other project ideas with the salvaged lumber.
