Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Alan, and I'm a software engineer at [Ternary Inc](https://ternary.app/). At first, I expect posts will focus on dev topics, but eventually I would love to blog about other interests as well, e.g. ham radio, woodworking, and waffles.

I hope this blog keeps me diligent and honest, sharing cool snippets along the way.
